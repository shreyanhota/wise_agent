Wise Voice Agent
Overview
Wise Voice Agent is a voice-based customer support solution built with Twilio's Voice API, Dialogflow, Python Flask, and deployed on Render. It handles incoming calls, processes user queries through natural language understanding, and responds with pre-defined FAQ answers stored in a JSON file. The agent is designed to streamline customer support by quickly providing answers to frequently asked questions about money transfers.

Architecture
Twilio Voice API: Handles incoming calls, text-to-speech responses, and gathers caller input.
Dialogflow: Processes and extracts intents from the user's spoken queries.
Python Flask: Serves as the backend application framework that integrates Twilio and Dialogflow.
JSON Configuration: Stores FAQ responses mapped to specific intents.
Render Deployment: The entire application is hosted on Render, using Gunicorn as the production server.
How It Works
Call Handling:
When a call is received, the agent greets the user and prompts for a query. The call flow is managed using Twilio’s Gather functionality.

Intent Detection:
The spoken query is sent to Dialogflow, which analyzes it and returns the corresponding intent. If the intent matches one of the FAQ topics, the system retrieves a summarized answer from the JSON file.

Response & Feedback:
The agent delivers the answer and then asks, "Would you like to know more, or did that answer your query?" The feedback is then processed—if the response corresponds to one of the FAQ topics, the conversation loops back to the inquiry phase.

Fallback & Escalation:
If the intent is not recognized or the answer is unclear, the agent requests clarification or routes the call to a human agent as needed.

Option Listing:
A specific intent allows users to ask for the list of available FAQ options, which are then read out as a complete list.

Deployment
The project is deployed as a single web service on Render. The application serves both the Flask backend and static frontend (if any). Key steps include:

Organizing the project with a standard Flask structure (e.g., placing index.html in a templates folder).
Creating a Procfile to instruct Render to start the application using Gunicorn.
Configuring environment variables (such as Twilio and Dialogflow credentials) via Render’s dashboard.
Pushing the code to GitHub and connecting the repository to Render for continuous deployment.
Future Improvements and Next Steps
Enhanced Intent Training:
Improve the training phrases in Dialogflow to capture a wider range of user queries and to increase the accuracy of intent detection.

Expand FAQ Topics:
Add more detailed FAQ topics based on user feedback and support analytics to further enrich the knowledge base.

Logging and Monitoring:
Implement robust logging and monitoring mechanisms to track interactions, detect errors, and analyze performance metrics.

Testing and Validation:
Develop unit tests and integration tests to ensure reliability. Incorporate input validation and error handling to improve system robustness.

User Experience Enhancements:
Refine voice interactions and consider adding multi-language support for a more personalized experience. Improve the dialogue flow and clarity of responses.

Human Agent Integration:
Enhance the process for routing calls to human agents when the automated system cannot resolve a query effectively.

Analytics Dashboard:
Build an analytics dashboard to monitor common queries, track system performance, and inform future improvements.

Conclusion
The Wise Voice Agent is a pioneering project that leverages modern cloud telephony and natural language processing to provide efficient customer support. With further improvements in intent training, FAQ expansion, and system monitoring, the agent can evolve into an even more robust and user-friendly solution for handling customer inquiries.

We welcome contributions and feedback to help drive this project forward.
